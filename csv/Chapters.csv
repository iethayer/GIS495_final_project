0,Climate Change,media/UStopo.png,,,"Coastal communities are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. These gasses trap heat in the atmosphere, disrupting global climate patterns. Not all coastal areas are equally impacted by sea level rise. In fact, sea levels rise unevenly and vary from location to location. Flat coastal areas and locations susceptible to tropical storms are especially vulnerable to the powerful effects of sea level rise. The U.S. East Coast is one of these locations, along with others such as the Gulf Coast, islands, and Asia. ",4.0,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,0.9,,
1,Sea Level Rise Scenarios,media/GhostForest.png,,,There are five future sea level rise scenarios as designated by the US Interagency Sea Level Rise Task Force. These projections are based on data from the IPCC and are for the year 2100. <ul> <li>Low: 1 ft</li> <li>Intermediate-Low: 1.6 ft</li> <li>Intermediate: 3.3 ft</li> <li>Intermediate-High: 4.9 ft</li> <li>High: 6.6 ft</li> </ul>,6.0,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,0.9,,

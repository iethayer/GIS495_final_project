0,Climate Change on the Coast,media/UStopo.png,,,"Coastal communities are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. These gasses trap heat in the atmosphere, disrupting global climate patterns. Not all coastal areas are equally impacted by sea level rise. In fact, sea levels rise unevenly and vary from location to location. Flat coastal areas and locations susceptible to tropical storms are especially vulnerable to the powerful effects of sea level rise. The U.S. East Coast is one of these locations, along with others such as the Gulf Coast, islands, and Asia. ",4.0,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,0.9,,
1,Sea Level Rise Scenarios,media/GhostForest.png,,,There are five future sea level rise scenarios as designated by the US Interagency Sea Level Rise Task Force. These projections are based on data from the IPCC and are for the year 2100. <ul> <li>Low: 1 ft</li> <li>Intermediate-Low: 1.6 ft</li> <li>Intermediate: 3.3 ft</li> <li>Intermediate-High: 4.9 ft</li> <li>High: 6.6 ft</li> </ul>,6.0,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,0.9,,
2,NC Marsh Migration,media/Marsh.gif,,,"Based on the five sea level rise scenarios, NC wetlands have the potential to drastically change. With just the low end of the SLR projection, brackish/transition wetland significantly increases, suggesting a rise in saltwater intrusion.",15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,0.9,,
3,Flooding,media/avg_flood.png,,,"Historically, the number of flood days per year has been on the rise since at least 2000. Since then, the average annual flood days for coastal NC areas has tripled. Continuing on this upward trend in flood days will only harm coastal ecosystems.",6.0,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,0.9,,
4,Saltwater Intrusion & Ghost Forests in NC,media/GhostForest.png,,,"Saltwater intrusion occurs due to flooding events and sea level rise, both factors excacerbated by climate change. The introduction of saltwater has negative effects on coastal ecosystems, as sea water reaches further and further inland. These freshwater species are not acclimated to saltwater. This saltwater eventually kills off these plants and trees, transitioning from a coastal forest ecosystem to a salt marsh ecosystem. This middle period of transition is often marked by ghost forests, patches of dead trees called snags that appear gray and are left standing upright. Since habitats are changing, animals will also change. This also often results in room for invasive species.

5,Conclusion & Next Steps,,,,"Overall, data is limited in coastal regions of NC. Not all coastal station data was up to date or had historical records. Marsh areas are significantly impacted from climate change as this brings harmful situations such as rising sea levels and an increase in flooding events. These all come together to bring saltwater further inland, killing coastal forests and leaving standing dead trees in their place. It's uncertain exactly how much sea level will rise, but even on the lower projected end there are detrimental effects to coastal NC ecosystems.",6.0,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",35.7796,-78.6382,,,,
